## Module: Deploying Fine-Tuned Model with Ray and Amazon S3

### Objective

In this module, we will walk through the steps required to deploy a Ray service that utilizes our previously fine-tuned model, using the pre-signed url generated before. 

### Deploy RayService to Kubernetes Cluster

#### Step 1: Update the `working_dir` in RayService Manifest

**Objective**: To provide the Ray service with the location from which it should fetch the serving script.

1. Navigate to the directory containing Ray manifests:

```bash
cd ray_serve_manifests
```

2. Update the `working_dir` with the previously generated Presigned URLand save it:

```yaml
serveConfigV2: |
    applications:
      - name: falcon_finetuned_financial_data
        import_path: serve_script.deployment_finetuned 
        route_prefix: /falcon_finetuned_financial
        runtime_env:
          working_dir: "PASTE YOUR PREVIOUSLY GENERATED PRESIGNED URL HERE"
```

#### Step 2: Deploy the RayService

Apply the updated YAML manifest to deploy the Ray service:

```bash
kubectl apply -f 00_ray_serve_fine_tuned.yaml
```

### Verify Deployment

After applying the manifest, you can verify the status of the RayService, and explore its corresponding resources:

1. **Check the RayService**:
```bash
kubectl get rayservices -n ray-svc-finetuned
```

2. **Check the Pods**:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ray-svc-finetuned
```

3. **Check the Node Provisioning**:
```bash
kubectl get nodes -l provisioner=gpu-serve
```

4. **Check NVIDIA GPU Operator**:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n gpu-operator
```

5. **Wait for Resources to Initialize**:
```bash
kubectl get pods -n ray-svc-finetuned -w
```

> It can take a while to initialize because of the dependencies (GPU Operator and pulling Ray Images)

### Verifying the Deployed Application

#### Check if the Service is Running

To ensure that the service exposing our non-fine-tuned model is active and running, execute the following command:

```bash
kubectl get svc -n ray-svc-finetuned
```

**Expected Output**:

You should see an output similar to the following:

```bash
ray-svc-finetuned-head-svc                    ClusterIP   172.20.214.232   <none>        10001/TCP,8265/TCP,52365/TCP,6379/TCP,8080/TCP,8000/TCP   36m
ray-svc-finetuned-raycluster-kmfjg-head-svc   ClusterIP   172.20.37.172    <none>        10001/TCP,8265/TCP,52365/TCP,6379/TCP,8080/TCP,8000/TCP   52m
ray-svc-finetuned-serve-svc                   ClusterIP   172.20.91.55     <none>        8000/TCP
```

The service named `ray-svc-finetuned-serve-svc` should be visible and listen on port `8000/TCP`.

#### Access the Service

For the sake of this demonstration, we are not using a LoadBalancer or Ingress to expose the service. Instead, we'll use the `port-forward` command to route traffic to the service.

> **Note**: Open a new terminal for this step.

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/ray-svc-finetuned-serve-svc 8000:8000 -n ray-svc-finetuned
```

### Interacting with the Deployed Model

#### Set Up the Chatbot Application

We have prepared a sample chatbot application that will interact with our deployed model.

1. **Navigate to the sample application directory**:

```bash
cd ../sample_app
```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Define the model endpoint as an environment variable**:

```bash
export MODEL_ENDPOINT="/falcon_finetuned_financial"
```

#### Run the Application

With the environment variable set, you can now run the chatbot application.

```bash
python app.py
```

#### Access the Chatbot

Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7860` to start interacting with your deployed model.

Let's ask the same question that we asked for the non-finetuned model

**Question:** Why do I need an emergency fund if I already have investments?
